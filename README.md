Crowdsourced Word Sequence Aggregation 2019

Data and code for "A Dataset of Crowdsourced Word Sequences: Collections and Answer Aggregation for Ground Truth Creation" by Jiyi Li and Fumiyo Fukumoto, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 Workshop of AnnoNLP (Aggregating and analysing crowdsourced annotations for NLP)

# Data format

1. *_label_anonymous.tsv: [worker \t sentence \t workeranswer]

the crowdsourced word sequence data. We anonymize the worker ids used on the crowdsourcing platform.

2. *_gt.tsv: [sentence \t trueanswer]

the original sentences (true answer) in the target language, for evaluation of the answer aggregation methods.
